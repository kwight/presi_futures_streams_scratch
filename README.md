# Futures and Streams

Async programming is integral to Dart and Flutter, but Futures and Streams can be confusing. Let's dig in to how Dart handles data it doesn't have yet, and what it means for Flutter when rendering UI.

We'll be kicking off our first meetup of the year at [TTT Studios](https://ttt.studio/), who have generously donated our space for the evening â€“ thanks! <3

These Dart demos can be run from the command line with `dart main.dart`. To use them as a basic local REPL, add a filewatcher (during the presentation, I used [filewatcher](https://github.com/filewatcher/filewatcher) to refresh on every save with the command `filewatcher * "clear && dart main.dart"`).
